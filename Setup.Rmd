# Data Generating Mechanism

We will use a prediction model with: 

- 1 binary outcome ($Y$),
- 2 binary predictors ($X_1$, $X_2$),
- 2 continuous predictors ($X_3$, $X_4$).

Our sample will include at least these 5 variables too.

**Q: Do we want extra 'support' variables ($Z$) in our sample that are not included in the prediction model?**

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# environment
library("mvtnorm")
library("dplyr")

# functions
source("./R/DGM.R")
```


```{r}
# let's generate some data
set.seed(11)
n <- 100
dat <- sample_predictors(n)
glimpse(dat)
```
